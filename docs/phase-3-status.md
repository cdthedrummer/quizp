# Phase 3 Status and Next Steps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read All Docs First
Before continuing development, ensure you've read all documentation in the `/docs` folder and the quiz question document. This contains crucial information about:
- App architecture
- Question structure
- Attribute scoring system
- UI/UX requirements

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Welcome Screen
   - Responsive layout
   - Custom title image
   - Attribute icons
   - Navigation structure
   - Quicksand font integration

2. Basic Structure
   - Question model implementation
   - Initial routing
   - Asset management
   - Basic navigation flow

### üèóÔ∏è In Progress
1. Question Implementation
   - Question data structure defined
   - Need to implement full question set
   - Need to add scoring logic

2. Quiz Flow
   - Basic navigation set up
   - Need to implement state management
   - Need to add progress tracking

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Quiz Screen Implementation
   - Create question card component
   - Implement answer selection logic
   - Add progress indicator
   - Handle different question types (single, multiple, scale)

2. State Management
   - Track quiz progress
   - Store user responses
   - Calculate running scores
   - Implement back navigation

3. Results Screen
   - Design attribute score visualization
   - Create personalized recommendations
   - Add retry functionality
   - Implement share feature

## Known Issues to Address
1. Code Cleanup
   - Remove unused imports
   - Add const constructors where appropriate
   - Update deprecated opacity methods
   - Fix test file class naming

## Development Guidelines
1. Maintain minimal dependencies
2. Focus on responsive design
3. Keep text user-friendly and accessible
4. Ensure smooth transitions between screens
5. Test on various screen sizes (especially foldables)

## Testing Priorities
1. Question navigation flow
2. Score calculation accuracy
3. UI responsiveness
4. Data persistence
5. Error handling

## Next Session Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Run the app
flutter run
```

Remember to test on both folded and unfolded states for foldable devices!
